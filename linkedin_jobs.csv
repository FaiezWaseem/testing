In this challenging economy every client wants to save $$$'s and they want the best value for their money. Jobseekers need to self-evaluate if they have the requisite skills to meet client requirements and needs as Clients now post covid can also hire remote workers which increases even more competition for jobseekers
.We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped 1000's of candidates get jobs at technology clients likebs etc to name a few
